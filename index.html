		<h1>Welcome!</h1> 
		<p>
			Hello! Welcome to my page of visual representations. Each visual is coded was sketched in illustrator and then coded in p5.js with lots of love. Feel free to explore the work of an ambitiuos designer, passionate about the cross section between mechanical engineering and architecture, who is simply trying to survive MIT. Go ahead! Scroll down! You'll find the wonders of time, the hights of heat, the number of part asians, and the prices of corn flakes.

		I created twelve different visual representations of a clock. These range from abstract to very literal. Click below to watch time pass.

			The inspiration for this project was the census. Here, I looked specifically at the relationship between multiracial individuals and their communiites or geographic locations. Take a look below to see how I arrived at my final visualizatoin.

			<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NHsqwdlLfdsXn-eCMNOnUu1RuptR7kh37Hqe9A0NXGE/edit#slide=id.p"> It starts with 3 ideas. </a>.

		<h1><a name="04-Final">4. Final Project</a></h1> 
		<p>
			In this six week assignment you will follow your own adventure. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<h2>Week 1: Find your own project</h2>
			For your final project come up with at least one concept for the following four directions. This project should be larger in scope and complexity than the census project, as you have six weeks to complete it. It should also be something you're passionate about and are interested in. The categories are below:
			<ul>
				<li>Personal: some type of personal data that you’ve collected </li>
				<li>Research/class: information design questions around your research, other classes, or thesis</li>
				<li>Explanation: a complex idea that’s data-centric, and make sense of it</li>
	<li>Curiosity: finding a data set that you think is interesting, and telling us a story about it or providing people with a way to explore it</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<h2>Week 2: Sketches and Parsing</h2>
			Decide for one of the four projects you came up with in the previous week. Create a first sketch of how you think you want to show the information. Think about the wireframing we talked about. Try to put everything in place that you think will be part of it. Start parsing the data. Where do you get it from? How does it look like? Can you access it computationally through an api, json, csv? Collect references that you find relevant for your projects: Graph types, visual language, typography. Prepare a short presentation on google slides, github or as pdf and submit it in Stellar

		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<h2>Week 3: Second design iteration and prototype</h2>
			 Create a final version of your design. It should consider all the relevant elements: Graph types, typography, layout, color. Think of the wireframe discussion we had earlier. Then, build a working prototype in code that loads and parses data and displays it. It is ok if that prototype is not final as long as you have the core functionality in place. <br>
In addition to this build your github.io index page that links to all your projects hosted on github. Ultimately you will present all your work from there.		</p>
